Hello, <*name*>!
<br>
My name is Gustav Almstrom and I've made a game which you might find interesting. Here's some quick info.
<br>
<br>
<b>Game:</b> BoyandBox, you are a boy who runs around and jumps. You also have the power to control a teleporting box, which you can use both as a platform to jump off of, as well as a shield to protect yourself from enemies. The world in where the game takes place is infected by a red flowery plague, and your mission is to find the origin, and stop it before it's too late.

<b>Dev:</b> 17 years old and lives in Sweden. Does all of the programming, art, and music solo. Works on game when not in school.
