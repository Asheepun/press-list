My favorite thing is seeing player testers learn how to coordinate the boy and the box, and seeing them managing to complete some of the harder levels. The thing is that your abilities never change throughout the game. Yet you become much more capable at the game the more you play, and things which looked completely impossible when you first saw them feel like child's play the second time through. Almost every level has a little nonverbal lesson about the game's mechanics built into them, and by the end the player will hopefully have mastered the art of maneuvering a boy and a little box.
